# Archived Build and Compose Variants

This folder contains alternative Dockerfiles and Compose files kept for reference. The default build path uses the root `Dockerfile` and two compose files:

- Development: `docker-compose.yml`
- Production: `docker-compose.production.yml`

Archived examples (not used in main CI/CD path):
- `Dockerfile.simple`
- `Dockerfile.minimal`
- `Dockerfile.robust`
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `docker-compose.staging.yml`
- `deploy/docker-compose.yml`

Refer to README for the main build & deploy guidance.
